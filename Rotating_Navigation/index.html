        <h1>Amazing Kitten Adoption Article</h1>

        <p>
          On July 6th, 2023 while visting family in Houston, TX we visited the
          local pet shelter and came across 'The Sisters Kittens'.
          Unfortunately, we were visting the shelter after hours for adopting
          and was told we would have to come back the next day. When we returned
          the next day to adopt them both, but only one kitten was remaining. We
          tried to get the information of the person that adopted only one of
          the kittens, but the shelter would not share their information due to
          privacy.
